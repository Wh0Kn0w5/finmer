				"Your form looms over the battered and rather defenseless lion. In one swift motion, your jaws part and immediately slather your prey with warm, sticky saliva. You engulf his head inside your maw and eagerly begin swallowing. Hungrily, you shove the lion down your throat, completely ignoring his loud protesting and kicking legs. One of your paws roams around on your {player.furry} belly as it expands to accomodate the large struggling meal. Thick drool leaks down your prey as you make quick work of the rest. The lion's legs rapidly vanish down your gullet and settle in that swollen {player.species}-gut. A loud belch, splattering drool in front of you, is all that's left of the unfortunate preything."

				"As your struggles inevitably slow down, Randall gives his oversized furry gut a slap, the doughy dome jiggling as fluid splashes around. \"Come on, already? They usually last longer,\" he taunts. \"Squirm some more for me, will ya?\" But alas, your weakened and well-tenderized body is easily pickings for the onslaught of the digestive organ. Rippling walls knead and chew away at you, splashing slime everywhere and regularly renewing the layers of gooey acid as it slowly but surely works on you. With no more air left to breathe and warm flesh closing in on all sides, you finally give out. Just another worthless lump of meat for the large wolf to process overnight."

				"When the gang boss squats down in the bushes the next morning, there is a lot less left of you. Inside the predator's stomach remains only a chunky stew, enough to make Randall's stomach swell out a fair bit, though nowhere near as much as the bulge you made last night. Most of that bulk has, indeed, either been added as a nice extra layer of pudge on the wolf's belly or hips, though an equally large part has been processed fully by the predator's digestive system.\\n\\nAfter a minute, Randall finishes emptying bowels, having piled your remains into a pretty impressive mound of wolf shit. The process is certainly not finished, though, and the lupine's stomach gurgles loudly as it resumes digesting its large meal. For now, however, the gang boss is satisfied and carelessly walks away, a smug grin on his muzzle, already thinking about who to swallow next."

				"The black wolf spreads his jaws, taking a few more precious seconds to breathe hot, sour wolfbreath on your face, before he shoves you forward into the fetid tunnel of warm, writhing flesh. Your muzzle breaks several sticky strands of saliva as you touch, and start sliding across the predator's meaty tongue. With several loud, powerful swallows, the muscle around you expertly grips your face and squeezes, forcing you into the wolf's digestive tract. Randall greedily gulps down his latest catch, and before long your nose enters the opening into the predator's stomach. The stench that hits you is unbearable; some mixture of an acid pit and whatever the wolf ate last. The digestive sack has been busy even before your arrival; acidic slime trickles and seeps from between every fold of flesh. Thick goop coats the walls and forms a pool of sorts near the bottom - probably what little remains of the previous soul to venture into the gang boss's jaws, and also a nice reminder of what's about to happen to you, too. With each noisy swallow, more of your body is deposited into the warm, accommodating organ and you are forced to curl up into a {player.furry} ball of {player.species}-meat. Once Randall finishes devouring you, your feet join you inside the caustic furnace and the wolf on the outside licks his paws clean, giving his massive gut a few loving pats. The searing hot flesh quickly begins clenching and kneading away at you, eager to grind you down into the same meaty slush that surrounds you."
