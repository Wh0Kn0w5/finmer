Though your desire for fresh air is momentarily relieved, the rank, hot and acidic stench is not much better than when you were forced to hold your breath. The stomach is surprisingly roomy, likely owing to your predator's physiology, though once more of your body gets crammed into the tight space, that room quickly runs out. Warm, intricately folded stomach walls mold around you neatly and crush you into a tight ball. Once you are fully inside, the stomach sphincter seals shut behind you, leaving you entombed within this digestive furnace, stomach walls holding you tightly in place while liquid and thick slime dribbles down from everywhere."

The guard certainly wastes no time getting {guard.possessive} prey down. With practiced force, your arms are squeezed to your sides, keeping you locked down and unable to resist your descent down the oppressively hot digestive system. Drool leaks down your chest as more and more of your body vanishes down the ravenous guard's throat, your fur easily matted down, lubed up for the trip.\\n\\nBefore long, you breach the stomach sphincter as your head and shoulders are forced into the cramped, superheated chamber. Rippling waves of muscular pressure force you down into the stomach little by little, and for a few moments you're pushed into a thin pool of slime and viscous goo. As your belly, thighs and legs join you inside the stomach, you are squeezed and curled up into a tight {player.furry} ball. Mere moments after your toes leave the sphincter's touch with a disgustingly wet squelch, a deafening belch rumbles your surroundings. Fluids splatter everywhere, and the stomach walls take the opportunity to cave in on you, smothering you in soft, slimy warmth."
