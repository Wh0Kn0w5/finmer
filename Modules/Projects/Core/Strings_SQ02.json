A low, powerful growl reverberates through the air, the canine's bushy tail rising. Maybe he doesn't like you... a thought made all the more obvious when the growl breaks into a full on snarl and the massive lupine prepares to pounce on you."

A low, powerful growl reverberates through the air, the canine's bushy tail rising. If you run, you must be prey... a thought made all the more obvious when the growl breaks into a full on snarl and the massive lupine prepares to pounce on you."

				"You decide it's best to stay still, and avoid staring at the majestic wolf. Eye contact is some kind of a dominance thing with canines, you've been told. Now the great lupine's curiosity is fully piqued, and he calmly rises up on all fours, gives a stretch and a long yawn, before he slowly walks over to you. Despite the massive size of those paws, and the light dents they leave in the soil, they are almost inaudible - truly a hallmark of a dangerously powerful predator. The dire wolf hasn't attacked you quite yet, but the question it asks is obvious: what are you doing here?"

The wolf lets out a surprised growl, but oddly enough, does not make an attempt to stop you. So with this implicit approval in mind, you let your paws roam around the wolf's belly, rubbing and kneading away.\\n\\nEventually, the large canine turns to face you. His nose touches yours, and you can't help but note how his muzzle is larger than your entire head - it's a bit intimidating. Then, without warning, the lupine's maw opens wide, his long, slimy tongue rolling out for you like a carpet. Hot wolf breath washes against you as he patiently waits, reeking of whatever meat and animal went down that gaping gullet last time. He stays like this, his bushy tail swaying back and forth, as if waiting for your response."

The wolf initially recoils at your movements, but once the tasty-looking fish is presented - and probably its scent - that quickly changes. The great canine carefully steps forwards, and after a few moments of testing your reactions, snatches it from your paws. It goes down whole, with a single loud gulp. As the lupine's tail gives a slow, gentle wag, his mouth opens again slightly as the predator starts panting lightly. Well, sure does seem like he liked that snack.\\n\\nHis nose touches yours, and you can't help but note how his muzzle is larger than your entire head - it's a bit intimidating.

To your surprise, you spot a massive canine sleeping just ahead - a wolf. It looks easily as tall as you are, though right now it's lying on its side, loosely curled.

In a split second, a loud, pained yelp echoes through the clearing as steel meets flesh. The wolf's panicked cry quickly turns to a gurgle before stopping, as do a few small twitches of his limbs. With a disgusting slicing sound and a crack, you cut the dire wolf's head clean off. Blood splatters everywhere, thoroughly infesting the late feral's fur and your clothing. The crimson fluid flows freely on the mossy ground and a distinct, stinging metallic scent hits your nose, reaffirming what exactly it is you're doing. Perhaps it's best to not linger around here for too long."

His eyes widen as he spots the wolf head, but he's quick to make his way over there and lift the thing off of the table, all the while looking as if he'd rather not be touching it.\\n\\nCanbell turns to you with an impassive stare, before she reaches into a drawer behind her and pulls out a small purse, then slides it across the table. \"Well, thank you, I suppose.

Being so close to its source, it is difficult not to be shaken slightly. Suddenly, the stomach walls begin convulsing and rippling around you with intense force. You think for a second the stomach has finally realized what to do with its meal, but then the muscular waves of peristalsis begin squeezing somewhere and you realize the wolf is coughing and hacking. Before long, you re-emerge into the canine's cavernous maw, and are spat back up onto the cool forest floor. Being utterly and completely soaked in wolf drool and stomach slime, you take a few seconds to recover, take in the fresh morning air and sunlight, and steel yourself against the harsh cold that comes with being wet. A long, gentle lick is planted on the side of your head - almost like a kiss goodbye. When you turn to face your mystery protector, the dire wolf turns and sprints away, its bushy tail waving slightly and its hind paws kicking up dirt.\\n\\nAfter you spend a few more moments wiping the worst of the thick, sticky saliva off of yourself, you realize the wolf has left you on the outskirts of the woods, close to the cozy-looking cabin."

As soon as you make contact with the slick stomach walls, they clench around their newest prize, eager to get to know you inside out.

He glances over at the wiggly bulge on his gut, and lovingly licks and noses it. You, on the other hand, are not quite having as much fun. Defeated, sapped of your strength and now of your precious air, your body falls limp in the loving embrace of the canine's belly, now not much more than just a ball of meat to digest and absorb. To the wolf, you're just another snack to keep him satisfied throughout the night - certainly not the first adventurer he'd devour, and hopefully not the last."
