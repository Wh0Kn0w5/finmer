				"The winding road leads to the forest edge, and ends right next to a cozy-looking wooden hut that's settled neatly next to the untamed woods. This must be where the carpenter you were told about lives. It's a rather picturesque place - living here must be beautiful in its own right, if a bit isolated from society. Past the cabin, further to the east, the expanse of pine trees begins, skylight filtering through the leaves to create an inviting scenery."

You have no idea how much this means to me!\" Flustered, he puts the box away on a shelf, then fetches something else off of it. \"Here, you'll probably have more use for this than I do,\" he says as he hands you a vial and some coins. He nods again."
